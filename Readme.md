# MINI PROJECT 2: DATA CURATION / WRANGLING
OBJECTIVE
The goal of this Mini Project 2 is to practice the various steps in the data curation process

BACKGROUND
DATA CURATION
Data Curation, also referred to as data cleaning, involves three steps: Data Sourcing, Data Profiling, and Data Wrangling.
Below are more detailed explanations of each step in the data curation process followed by instructions on what to turn
in for the Data Curation deliverable.


STEP 1: DATA SOURCING
You have already been given the primary dataset consisting of the three files. It is sometimes necessary or helpful to supplement your data with additional datasets to assist in your analysis. For the purposes of this Mini Project this is not required but you should be aware and think about what additional, external data sources could complement your analysis.

STEP 2: DATASET PROFILING
Data profiling refers to the process of “examining, analyzing, reviewing and summarizing data sets to gain insight into the quality of data”. The purpose of this step is to make sure the data is suitable for analysis.

There are three main types of data profiling:
 1. Structure discover
 • Checking data types and format for consistency
 • Mathematical checks where necessary (e.g. using sum, min, max)
 • Exploring distinct values in each column
 2. Content discovery
 • Looking for errors in individual rows?
 • Identifying zero/blank/null values
 3. Relationship discovery
 • Check if data is related to other cells

Typical output for this step in the data curation process would be identifying and documenting your findings from the above. There are advanced profiling techniques that we encourage fellows to try. Please see panoply for more information.

STEP 3: DATA WRANGLING
With your datasets sourced, you now need to wrangle them. This entails cleaning your datasets and setting them up to
be compatible with one another. Keeping track of this is important. You may need to demonstrate how you transformed
the raw dataset into what you used in your analysis. You might need to go back and see how the variables from the
different datasets align.
The exact steps differ from project to project but here are some examples of data wrangling:
 • Merging multiple data sources
 • Identifying missing data and how to handle it
 • Deleting unnecessary data
 • Identifying outliers
 • Checking and fixing data types
The main steps of data wrangling are:
 1. Data structuring
 2. Data cleaning
 3. Data enriching
 4. Data validating
 5. Data publishing (this step is not necessary)

To learn more about data wrangling, we recommend the following:
 • Data Wrangling: What It Is & Why It’s Important (hbs.edu)
 • Data Wrangling (Wikipedia)

 WHY ARE WE DOING ALL THIS?
When looking for good data, a lot of what we do leads nowhere. This can be extremely frustrating because it can feel like we wasted our time. However none of this time was wasted! Remember the devil is in the details. Gaining a better understanding of your data allows you to identify your key variables and organize your data well for analysis. Subsequently you will have a sense for what types of visualizations to create!

Typical output from this step is detailed documentation of the wrangling steps you used on your data. In this section these may include:
 1. Listing all the cleaned datasets you are using.
 • Document how each one was wrangled
 2. Note down the size of the dataset in terms of rows, columns and file size.
 3. List the original source(s) of the cleaned data set.
 4. Creating a data table schema of the cleaned dataset.
 • This will outline each field in the dataset, value type, and a brief description of each column
